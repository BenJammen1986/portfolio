        <h2>My Family</h2><br>
        <img id="family1" src="img/family1.jpg" alt="A picture of my family">
        <p>My wife (Mandy) and I are high school sweethearts; we've been married for almost 10 years and have 3 boys:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Judah- in the middle (4 years old)</li>
          <li>Ezekiel- left (2 years old)</li>
          <li>Silas- He's the baby- duh... (6 months old)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>My wife has a growing Etsy community/online business which centers around Bible journaling and artwork: She is <strong>way more creative</strong> than I am (I'm sure she could and would give me great pointers on the styling of this page if I let her).</p>
        <p>Judah loves his preschool and is already learning how to read! He is really into Legos and drawing.</p>
        <p>Ezekiel (otherwise known as <strong>Bubba Zeke</strong>) is really learning how to put sentences together now, and is big enough to wrestle with his older brother.</p>
        <p>Silas is just about the happiest baby in the world- but the WORST of our boys to sleep train. We'll get through it :-).</p>

        <br><h2>Activities/Hobbies</h2>
        <p>When I'm not focused on school work or my boys- which, right now, is pretty much 100% of the time- I really enjoy:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Camping with family/friends</li>
          <li>Frisbee golf</li>
          <li>Bowling</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Frisbee golf was an obsession between the years I graduated up to the time we moved from Idaho. This is one of my groomsmen and myself psyching ourselves up for a round the morning of my wedding <em>(in our tuxes).</em></p>
        <p>Now I have a more healthy relationship with frisbee golf, it now falling into the category of "hobby" rather than obsession.</p><br>

        <h2>Plans and Goals</h2>
        <img id="me1" src="img/me1.jpg" alt="an image of Ben with a grassy background">
        <p><br>I am super excited about this journey into programming and, specifically, Android App development!</p>
        <p>The financial opportunities and flexibility that a career in this field can offer is attractive, but I'm even more enthusiastic about the opportunity to <strong>BUILD and create truly useful things applications</strong>, to use my brain while I'm working rather than shutting it off (like you tend to do in carpet installation), and the chance to team up with others to collaborate on projects in a "think-tank" kind of environment.</p>
        <p>I believe that the skills, discipline, and organizational structure that is necessary for success in this field will also transfer over to other areas that I'm passionate about and, in the future, want to pursue and grow in, like:
        <ul>
          <li>Church leadership and discipleship</li>
          <li>Educational application projects</li>
          <li>Leading and teaching my own kids!</li>
        </ul></p>
